# Daily-Coding-Problem-1---Google-Question-Resolution
Recently i found out this great website called Daily Coding Problem, this site sends you everyday a coding problem asked in coding interviews at companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. And this is my take at solving today's coding problem

Here is the question : 

"This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17."
