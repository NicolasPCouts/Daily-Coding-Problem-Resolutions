# Daily-Coding-Problem-7---Facebook
Here is the resolution to the seventh Coding Problem sent to me by www.dailycodingproblem.com
I just found out that recursion algorithms are very complicated. A repository that helped me a lot with this problem was from a user called [Ivan Mladenov](https://github.com/cwetanow/DailyCodingProblem), as you can see my code is almost identical to Ivan's

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this resolution, feel free to contact me.

Here is the Problem:

"This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.

You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed."
